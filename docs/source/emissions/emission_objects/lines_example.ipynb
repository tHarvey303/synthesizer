    "Emission lines are bright features in a spectrum caused by specific atomic transitions. In astronomy, these lines are often used to identify the presence of certain elements in celestial objects, such as galaxies or nebulae. The luminosity of these lines can vary significantly, and they can be influenced by various factors such as redshift, dust extinction, and the physical conditions of the emitting gas. \n",

    "In Synthesizer emission lines are encapsulated by the ``LineCollection`` object. This object holds an arbitrary collection of emission lines, with each luminosity, continuum, line ID, and wavelength stored in arrays. However, as well as providing an interface to these arrays, the ``LineCollection`` can also be treated as a dictionary. \n",
