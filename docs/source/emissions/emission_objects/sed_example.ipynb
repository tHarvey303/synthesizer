    "# The Sed object\n",
    "\n",
    "A Spectral Energy Distribution, or SED, describes the energy distribution of an emitting body as a function of frequency / wavelength. In Synthesizer, spectra are stored in ``Sed`` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different ways to generate spectra in Synthesizer, but in every case the resulting SED is always stored in an ``Sed`` object. \n",
    "An ``Sed`` object in Synthesizer is generally agnostic to where the input spectra has come from, as you'll see below; they can therefore be initialised with any arbitrary wavelength and luminosity density arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Sed`` class contains a number of methods for calculating derived properties, such as broadband luminosities / fluxes (within wavelength windows or on [filters](../../observatories/filters.rst)) and spectral indices (e.g. balmer break, UV-continuum slope), and for modifying the spectra themselves, for example by applying an attenuation curve due to dust. Many of these methods are automatically used during emission generation with an ``EmissionModel``, but they can also be used directly from the ``Sed`` objects themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we cover the basics of instantiating and interacting with ``Sed`` objects, and how to use them to calculate derived properties."
