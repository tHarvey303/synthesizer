Synthesizer
^^^^^^^^^^^

Synthesizer is an open-source python package for generating synthetic astrophysical observables. It is modular, flexible, fast and extensible.

This documentation provides a broad overview of the various components in synthesizer and how they interact.
The `getting started guide <getting_started/getting_started>`_ contains download and installation instructions, as well as an overview of the code.

For detailed examples of what synthesizer can do, take a look at the `examples <auto_examples/index>`_ page.
A full description of the code base is provided in the `API <API>`_.
