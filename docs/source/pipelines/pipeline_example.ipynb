    "# The Pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a galaxy catalog (either of `Parametric` origin or from a simulation), an [`EmissionModel`](../emission_models/emission_models.rst), and a set of [instruments](../instrumentation/instrument_example.ipynb) you want observables for, you can easily write a pipeline to generate the observations you want using the Synthesizer UI. However, lets say you have a new catalog you want to run the same analysis on, or a whole different set of instruments you want to use. You could modify your old pipeline or write a whole new pipeline, but thats a lot of work and boilerplate. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `Pipeline` shines. Instead, of having to write a pipeline, the `Pipeline` class is a high-level interface that allows you to easily generate observations for a given catalog, emission model, and set of instruments. All you need to do is set up the ``Pipeline`` object, attach the galaxies, and pass the instruments to the observable methods you want to generate. Possible observables include:\n",

    "#### Collective I/O [WIP]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed ``h5py`` with parallel HDF5 its possible to write collectively to a single HDF5 file. A ``Pipeline`` will detect if parallel ``h5py`` is available and will automatically chose this option if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "When collective I/O operations aren't available we produce a file per MPI rank. This is the most efficient method since communicating the results to a single rank for outputting is not only extremely time consuming but can also lead to communication errors when the outputs are sufficiently large. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rank files have been written out we provide 2 options for combining them into a single file, note that working with the rank files is entirely possible though. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combination into a single physical file: calling ``combine_files`` will copy all the data across from each rank file into a single file before deleting each individual rank file. This is clean with regard to what is left, but is extremely time consuming.\n",
    "2. Combination into a single virtual file: calling ``combine_files_virtual`` will make a single file with symlinks to all the rank data in virtual datasets. This is far more efficient and gives the same interaction behaviour as the copy option (i.e. a single file to interact with) but does mean all the rank files must be kept alongside the virtual file.
