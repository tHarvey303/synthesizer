    "# The Pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a galaxy catalog (either of `Parametric` origin or from a simulation), an [`EmissionModel`](../emission_models/emission_models.rst), and a set of [instruments](../observatories/instrument_example.ipynb) you want observables for, you can easily write a pipeline to generate the observations you want using the Synthesizer UI. However, lets say you have a new catalog you want to run the same analysis on, or a whole different set of instruments you want to use. You could modify your old pipeline or write a whole new pipeline, but thats a lot of work and boilerplate. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the `Pipeline` shines. Instead, of having to write a pipeline, the `Pipeline` class is a high-level interface that allows you to easily generate observations for a given catalog, emission model, and set of instruments. All you need to do is set up the ``Pipeline`` object, attach the galaxies, and pass the instruments to the observable methods you want to generate with the necessary parameters. Possible observables include:\n",

    "- Spectra.\n",
    "- Emission Lines.\n",
    "- Photometry.\n",
    "- Images (with or without PSF convolution/noise).\n",

    "- Instrument specific spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Pipeline`` will generate all the requested observations for all (compatible) instruments and galaxies, before writing them out to a standardised HDF5 format.\n",

    "- Signalling which observables to generate with which properties and instruments.\n",
    "- Running the ``Pipeline``.\n",
    "- Writing the outputs.\n",

    "## Setting up a ``Pipeline`` object\n",

    "## Hybrid parallelism with MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we demonstrated how to run a pipeline using only local shared memory parallelism. We can also use `mpi4py` to not only use the shared memory parallelism but also distribute the analysis across multiple nodes (hence \"hybrid parallelism\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instatiating a ``Pipeline`` when using MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of MPI we only need to make a couple changes to running the pipeline. The first is simply that we need to pass the ``comm`` object to the ``Pipeline`` object when we instantiate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mpi4py import MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "pipeline = Pipeline(\n",
    "    gal_loader_func=galaxy_loader,  \n",

    "\n",
    "Here ``verbose=1`` will mean only rank 0 will output logging information. If you want all ranks to output logging information you should set ``verbose=2``. ``verbose=0`` will silence all outputs apart from the greeting, total timing and errors as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding galaxies with MPI\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to partition the galaxies **before** we attach them to a ``Pipeline``. For now we provide no mechanisms for this, it is entirely up to you how to split galaxies across the ranks. The important thing is that you only pass the galaxies on a rank to ``add_galaxies``. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing out results with MPI  \n",
    "\n",
    "When running a distributed ``Pipeline`` you have several options for writing out the data. Regardless of which approach is used the process to write the outputs is the same as the shared memory version shown above (i.e. we call the ``write`` method). We detail each of these below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collective I/O [WIP]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed ``h5py`` with parallel HDF5 its possible to write collectively to a single HDF5 file. A ``Pipeline`` will detect if parallel ``h5py`` is available and will automatically chose this option if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "When collective I/O operations aren't available we produce a file per MPI rank. This is the most efficient method since communicating the results to a single rank for outputting is not only extremely time consuming but can also lead to communication errors when the outputs are sufficiently large. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rank files have been written out we provide 2 options for combining them into a single file, note that working with the rank files is entirely possible though. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combination into a single physical file: calling ``combine_files`` will copy all the data across from each rank file into a single file before deleting each individual rank file. This is clean with regard to what is left, but is extremely time consuming.\n",
    "2. Combination into a single virtual file: calling ``combine_files_virtual`` will make a single file with symlinks to all the rank data in virtual datasets. This is far more efficient and gives the same interaction behaviour as the copy option (i.e. a single file to interact with) but does mean all the rank files must be kept alongside the virtual file.
