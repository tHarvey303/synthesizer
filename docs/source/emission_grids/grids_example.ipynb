This is useful in workflows where you can't adopt a discrete value, but be warned that interpolating over a coarse grid can give unrealistic results. You can apply a transformation to the axis before interpolating, e.g. to interpolate in log-space rather than linear space, with the keyword argument `pre_interp_function`. \n",
