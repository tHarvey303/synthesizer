Instruments
================= 

Instrument object encapsulate the properties of different observatories. These can be real observatories, such as JWST, Euclid, or Hubble, or they can be entirely user defined. The instrument object contains the properties of the instrument, such as the wavelength range, resolution, and transmission. 

As well as allowing the user to define the properties of arbitrary instruments, we also provide a suite of pre-defined instruments that can be imported (or downloaded to include large datasets such as point spread functions and noise arrays).

In this section we detail creating and working with these objects.
