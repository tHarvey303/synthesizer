    "# Working with Instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with multi wavelength observations (i.e. observables from a range of instruments with a range of filters, resolutions, depths etc.) we need a way to collect the diverse technical properties of instruments. This is where ``Instrument`` and ``InstrumentCollections`` come in. An ``Instrument`` contains the the techincal properties of a single instrument, e.g. NIRCam filter curves, resolution, depths, SNR, or noise maps (we'll detail the use cases for the properties below). An ``InstrumentCollection`` is a container enabling manipulation of multiple ``Instruments`` in a single object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a ``Pipeline`` (see [pipeline docs](../pipelines/pipeline_example.ipynb)) ``InstrumentCollection`` objects are an important building block of automating pipelines to generate observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an ``Instrument``\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on different use cases in the section below. First we'll cover the creation of simple ``Instrument`` instances and combining them into ``InstrumentCollections``. For this we'll just use simple ``Instruments`` defining only the filters (which would be the case if you only want to generate photometry). We'll begin by creating two filter collections, one for Webb's NIRCam instrument and the other for generic UVJ top hats.\n",
