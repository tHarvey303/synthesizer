    "# Emission model basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we give an overview of the basic functionality of an ``EmissionModel``. Elsewhere we cover [what models are available](premade_models/premade_models.rst), [how to modify a model](modify_models.ipynb), [making your own custom models](custom_models.ipynb), and [combining models from different components](combined_models.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    " \n",
    "To use an ``EmissionModel`` model we simply instantiate it with the required arguments.\n",
    "However, which arguments are required depends on the exact operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extraction\n",
    "For *extraction* operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A grid to extract from (``grid``).\n",
    "- A key to extract (``extract``). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Generation\n",
    "For *generation* operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A generator class (e.g. a [stellar emission model](premade_models/stellar_models.ipynb)) from which to generate spectra (``generator``). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformation\n",
    "For *transformation* operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The transformer (e.g. a [dust curve](attenuation/dust_attenuation.ipynb) or [igm](attenuation/igm.ipynb)) to apply (``transformer``/``dust_curve``/``igm``, arguments are interchangable).\n",
    "- The model to apply the transformation to (``apply_to``).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combination\n",
    "For *combination* operations you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list of models which will be combined (i.e. added) to give the resultant emission (``combine``).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Masking\n",
    "Masking can be applied alongside any of the above operations.\n",
    "Any number of masks can be combined on the same operation.\n",
    "Each mask is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The attribute of the component to mask on (``mask_attr``).\n",
    "- The operator to use when generating the mask, i.e. ``\"<\"``, ``\">\"``, ``\"<=\"``, ``\">=\"``, ``\"==\"``, or ``\"!=\"`` (``mask_op``).\n",
