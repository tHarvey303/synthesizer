    "## Energy Balance vs Scaler Emission Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring specific dust models, it's important to understand the two fundamental approaches for dust emission in Synthesizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Balance Dust Emission\n",
    "Energy balance models calculate the dust luminosity from the energy absorbed by dust. This is done by taking the difference between the intrinsic (unattenuated) and attenuated stellar emission:\n",
    "\n",
    "L_dust = L_intrinsic - L_attenuated\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is physically motivated as it conserves energy: the energy absorbed by dust should equal the energy re-emitted in the infrared.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaler Dust Emission  \n",
    "Scaler models normalize a dust emission spectrum and then scale it by the bolometric luminosity of another emission component. This provides more flexibility in defining how the dust emission relates to other galaxy components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most examples below use the `get_spectra` method directly on the generators to show their spectral shapes, but in practice these generators are typically used within `EmissionModel` instances."
