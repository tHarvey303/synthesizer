    "# Intergalactic Medium Absorption\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuates the light from distant galaxies, even after reionisation.\n",
    "Synthesizer provides three analytic forms for this IGM absorption: ``Madau96``, ``Inoue14``, and ``Asada25``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Madau96`` model is based on [Madau et al. (1996)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...475..429M/abstract), and assumes a power-law relationship between the absorption and the redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Inoue14`` model is based on [Inoue et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.1805I/abstract), and includes the effects of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and Lyman--limit systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Asada25`` model is based on [Asada et al. 2025](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/adc388), and extends the ``Inoue14`` model by including additional Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) absorption at high redshifts (z>6). This model uses the Inoue+14 IGM prescription with an additional LyÎ± damping wing component calibrated from high-redshift observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting the transmission curves\n",
    "\n",
    "To simply visualize the transmission curves, we can simply instantiate the IGM class and call the `plot_transmission` method, passing our desired redshift and wavelength array (in Angstroms)."
