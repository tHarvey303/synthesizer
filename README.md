Synthesizer is a Python package for generating synthetic astrophysical observables. It is modular, flexible, extensible and fast.

Read the documentation [here](https://synthesizer-project.github.io/synthesizer/).

## Getting Started

The latest stable release of Synthesizer can be installed directly using pip,

```bash
pip install cosmos-synthesizer
```

Please refer to the [installation documentation](https://synthesizer-project.github.io/synthesizer/getting_started/installation.html) for further information.

**Note**: We do not currently support Windows, to use Synthesizer on Windows please install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Various configuration options can also be set at installation (see [here](https://synthesizer-project.github.io/synthesizer/advanced/config_options.html)).

## Getting Grids

In most use cases you will need a grid of theoretical spectra. Premade grids can be downloaded from the [grids data server](https://sussex.box.com/v/SynthesizerProductionGrids).

Note that you can also create your own grids using (or adapting) the [`grid-generation` repo](https://github.com/synthesizer-project/grid-generation).
